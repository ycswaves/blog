title: Minify JavaScript
---

**Minification** is the practice of removing unnecessary characters (that includes all comments and unneeded whitespace characters) from code to reduce its size, thereby improving load times.

**Obfuscation** is an alternative optimization that can be applied to source code. Besides doing what minification does, it also converts function and variable names into smaller strings making the code more compact and harder to read.
