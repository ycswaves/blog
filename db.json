A response contains a status code, headers and a body.\n\n#### Compression\nThe size of reponse can be reduced using compression if **both** the browser and server support it. For example, the browser announces its support of `gzip` using the `Accept-Encoding` header. The server identify compressed responses using the `Content-Encoding` header.\n\nRequest:\n```ruby\n  Accept-Encoding: gzip\n```\n\nResponse:\n```ruby\n  Content-Encoding: gzip\n```\n\n#### Conditional GET\nThe browser may cache certain resource files like `.css` and `.js` files. To make sure those cached files are not modified since the time of last retrieval, a conditional GET request is sent by using `If-Modified-Since` header.\n\n```ruby\n  If-Modified-Since: Fri, 24 Jul 2015 04:15:54 GMT\n```\n\nAnd if the requested resource is not expired, server will respond with a '304 Not Modified' status and **skip sending the reponse body**, resulting in a smaller and faster response.\n\n#### Keep-Alive\nHTTP is built on top of TCP.

Thus *Persistent Connections* (a.k.a \"Keep-Alive\" in HTTP/1.0) was introduced to let browsers make multiple requests over a single connection.\n\n```ruby\n  Connection: keep-alive\n```\n\nTechnically, `keep-alive` is not required in HTTP/1.1, but most browsers and servers still include it.\n\n\n\n","source":"_posts/2015-07-23-web-performance-overview.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Web Performance Overview\ncategory: notes\n---\n\n#### The Performance Golden Rule\n> Only 10-20% of the end user response time is spent downloading the HTML docu- ment.

Image Map\nThere are 2 types of them:  \n**Server-side** image maps: by submitting all clicks to the same destination URL, passing along the x,y coordinates of where the user clicked.  \n**Client-side**: The mapping is achieved via HTML's `<map>` tag.  \nExample:\n```html\n<img usemap=\"#map1\" border=0 src=\"/images/imagemap.gif\">\n<map name=\"map1\">\n  <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"0,0,31,31\" href=\"home.html\" title=\"Home\">\n  <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"36,0,66,31\" href=\"gifts.html\" title=\"Gifts\">\n  <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"71,0,101,31\" href=\"cart.html\" title=\"Cart\">\n  <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"106,0,136,31\" href=\"settings.html\" title=\"Settings\">\n  <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"141,0,171,31\" href=\"help.html\" title=\"Help\">\n</map>\n```\n\n### 2. CSS Sprite\nThe concept of CSS Sprite is to put all individual images into one big image and select part of it where you want it to be displayed as the background image of a html element (that supports background images like a `<span>` or `<div>`).\n\nTo \"select\" which image to show from the big image file, use the CSS `background-position` property\n```html\n<div style=\"background-image: url('css_sprites.gif');\n            background-position: -260px -90px;\n            width: 26px; height: 24px;\">\n</div>\n```\nThe 2 values, \"-260px\" and \"-90px\", defines the top-left position of the sprite-image. In this case, to display the target small image, it requires the sprite-image to move left by 260px and up by 90px. And that's why you never see positive values for `background-position`.\n\n### 3. Combined Scripts and Stylesheets\nGenerally, using external scripts and stylesheets is better for performance. From software engineering's point of view, it's good to modularize the code by breaking it into many small files, which means more HTTP requests.\n\nCombining files is easy, and minifying the files can also be done along with the combining process. However it will be difficult if different pages require different combinations of modules.

Moving scripts lower in the page means more content is rendered progressively.\n\n### Parallel Downloads\n\nResponse time mainly affected by the number of compoments (resource files) in the page. Each component generate an HTTP request. Browser performs HTTP requests in parallel but **can't** download them all at once.\n\nHTTP/1.1 suggests browsers to download two componnents in parallel per hostname. If a web page evenly distribute its components across two hostnames, the overall response would be about twice as fast. \n\nLimiting parallel downloads to two per hostname is a guideline. However, users can modify this setting in their browsers, and front-end engineers could use CNAMEs(DNS aliases) to split their components across multiple hostnames. Too many parallel downloads can degrade performance. Research at Yahoo! shows that splitting components across **two** hostnames leads to better performance than using 1, 4 or 10 hostnames.\n\n### Scripts Block Downloads\nThe benefits of parallel downloading is clear. However, parallel downloading is **disabled** while a **script** is downloading, even on different hostnames because:\n\n- The script may use `document.write` to alter the page content, so the browser waits to make sure the page is laid out appropriately.\n- To guarantee that the scripts are executed in the proper order, otherwise executing them out of order would result in JavaScript errors.\n\n### Putting It in Perspective\nIn some situations, it's not easy to move scripts to the bottom. For example if the script use `document.write` to insert part of the page's content. There might also be scoping issues. If that script doesn't contain `document.write`, you may use *deferred* scripts as a clue to browers that they can continue rendering. However, in Firefox, even deferred scripts block rendering and parallel downloads.","source":"_posts/2015-08-07-web-performance-scripts-at-bottom.md","raw":"---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Put Scripts at the Bottom\ncategory: notes\n---\n\nWith scripts, progressive rendering is blocked for all content *below* the script.

However, users can modify this setting in their browsers, and front-end engineers could use CNAMEs(DNS aliases) to split their components across multiple hostnames.

However, using external files in the real world generally produces faster page because of the benefit of being cached by the browser and the HTML document size will also be reduced by moving inline JS and CSS out of itself.\n\nThe key factor is the frequency with which external JS and CSS files are cached relative to the number of HTML documents requested. This can be gauged using following metrics:\n\n- **Page Views:** fewer page views per user, the stronger the argument for inlining JS/CSS and vice versa.\n\n- **Empty/Primed Cache:** if the nature of your site results in higher primed cache rates for your users, the benefit of using external files is greater. Users may show up with an empty cache, but make serveral subsequent page views with a primed cache.\n\n- **Component Reuse:** if the JS and CSS files can be shared among multiple pages, using external files becomes more advantageous. However, the caveat here is that you may end up with either \"few very big files\" or \"many small files\". Only if you can find a balance that results in a high reuse rate, make JS/CSS external is the way to go, otherwise inlining might make more sense.\n\n### Home Pages\nHome page might be the only exception where inlining is preferable. Take a look at the three metrics mentioned above from the perspective of home pages:\n\n*Page Views:* Home pages have a high number of page views per month but often only one page view per session.\n\n*Empty/Primed Cache:* The primed cache percentage might be lower than other sites.

However, using external files in the real world generally produces faster page because of the benefit of being cached by the browser and the HTML document size will also be reduced by moving inline JS and CSS out of itself.</p>\n<p>The key factor is the frequency with which external JS and CSS files are cached relative to the number of HTML documents requested. This can be gauged using following metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Page Views:</strong> fewer page views per user, the stronger the argument for inlining JS/CSS and vice versa.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Empty/Primed Cache:</strong> if the nature of your site results in higher primed cache rates for your users, the benefit of using external files is greater. Users may show up with an empty cache, but make serveral subsequent page views with a primed cache.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Component Reuse:</strong> if the JS and CSS files can be shared among multiple pages, using external files becomes more advantageous. However, the caveat here is that you may end up with either “few very big files” or “many small files”. Only if you can find a balance that results in a high reuse rate, make JS/CSS external is the way to go, otherwise inlining might make more sense.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Home-Pages\"><a href=\"#Home-Pages\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Home Pages\"></a>Home Pages</h3><p>Home page might be the only exception where inlining is preferable. Take a look at the three metrics mentioned above from the perspective of home pages:</p>\n<p><em>Page Views:</em> Home pages have a high number of page views per month but often only one page view per session.</p>\n<p><em>Empty/Primed Cache:</em> The primed cache percentage might be lower than other sites. For security reasons, many users elect to clear the cache every time they close the browser.</p>\n<p><em>Component Reuse:</em> The reuse rate is low. Many home pages are the only page a user visits on the site, so there is really no reuse.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-Best-of-Both-Worlds\"><a href=\"#The-Best-of-Both-Worlds\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Best of Both Worlds\"></a>The Best of Both Worlds</h3><p>Even if all the factors point to inlining, it still feels inefficient to add all that JS and CSS to the page and not take advantage of the browser’s cache.

When a user type a URL into the browser, a DNS resolver will return the IP address of the server hosting the site that the user requested.\n\nIf a server is replaced by one with a different IP address, DNS allows users to use the same hostname to connect to the new server; if multiple IP addresses can be associated with a hostname, DNS provides a high degree of redundancy for a web site.\n\nDNS typically takes 20~120 ms for the browser to look up the IP address for a given hostname. The browser can't download anything from this hostname until the DNS lookup is completed. The response time depends on the DNS resolver:\n\n- The load of requests on it\n- User's proximity to it\n- User's bandwidth speed\n\n### DNS Caching and TTLs\nDNS lookups are cached for bettern performance. There are multiple occasions of DNS being cached. One can occur on a special caching server maintained by the user's ISP or LAN. Another two are at user's side, one is in OS and the other in browser. If browser keeps a DNS record in its cache, then no need to bother OS. Otherwise, OS will either retrieve from its own cache or sends a request to a remote server (where potential slowdowns occur). In addtion, IP addresses could change and DNS caches consume memory. Therefore, the DNS records have to be periodically flushed from the cache, and several different configuration settings determine how often they are discarded.\n\n#### Factors Affecting DNS Caching\nThe DNS record returned from a lookup contains a time-to-live (TTL) value. This tells the client how long the record can be cached.\n\nWhile DNS cache in the OS respect the TTL, browsers often ignore it and set their own time limit. Furthermore, the `Keep-Alive` feature of the HTTP can override both the TTL and the browser's time limit.\n\nBrowsers put a limit on the number of DNS records cached, regardless of the time the records have been in the cache. Once reaching limit, early DNS records are discarded. However, the OS cache might still be there and that saves the effort to query for the record over the network.\n\n#### TTL Values\nThe TTL can range from 1 minute to 1 hour. If failover (when old server goes offline and new ones deployed) is critical, short TTL is chosen. Otherwise a longer TTL makes more sense because it reduces the number of DNS lookups.\n\n### Reducing DNS Lookups\nThe number of DNS lookups is equal to the number of unique hostnames in the web page. Reducing the number of unique hostnames reduces the number of DNS lookups. However, it has the potential to reduce the amount of parallel downloading. So the general guideline is to use at least 2 but no more than 4 hostnames. This results in a good compromise between reducing DNS lookups and allowing a high degree of parallel downloads.
